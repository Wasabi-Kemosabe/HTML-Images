        <h2>10. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>It’s all about atmosphere—from the goth clubs where you meet contacts, to the back alleys where you scavenge
            for
            rat blood, to the haunted Ocean House Hotel (one of the best quests in the game). Bloodlines’ ambitious use
            of
            White Wolf’s Vampire universe means it looks and feels different from the other sword and sorcery games on
            this
            list.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, that signature Troika ambition also means lots of bugs and some mechanics that just don’t mesh
            well. The endgame includes some particularly sloggy dungeons, but no other game truly drops you into a
            Vampire
            world. This is truly a cult classic of an RPG, and the fanbase has been patching and improving the game ever
            since release.</p>

        <h2>9. Dark Souls 3</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Name any similar-looking RPG made in the past five years, and chances are good Dark Souls will be named as an
            inspiration for its design. Still, Dark Souls 3 proves that no one does it quite so well as From Software.
            The
            spark of originality that was so compelling in Dark Souls 1 isn't quite as apparent here, the second sequel
            in
            just five years, but what remains is an impeccably designed combat-heavy RPG. It's far more responsive than
            its
            predecessors, demanding faster action and reaction without sacrificing the deliberate play Dark Souls
            popularized. Button mashing will get you nowhere but dead.</p>
        <p>Dark Souls 3 is the most approachable in the series thanks to frequent warp points, simplified online co-op
            and
            beautiful (and hideous) art that beckons you to explore every nook and corner. No game series manages to
            reward
            you so profoundly for scrutinizing its lore and unfurling its secrets, and Dark Souls 3's faster, tighter
            controls and animation make it the most fun Souls game to play.</p>

            align='right'>
        <h2>8. System Shock 2</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Lonely. That’s the defining emotion of Irrational’s debut game. You’ll hear audio logs from fascinating
            characters, many of whom are struggling to survive in a battle against the bio-terror creatures called the
            Many.
            But you won’t meet those people, because they didn’t make it.</p>
        <p>That loneliness is key because Shock 2 is all about taking things away from you. Ammo? Check: you’ll probably
            waste those on an assault droid when you should have saved them for later. Hypos? Yep. Think twice before
            you
            walk into that radiated room. But the biggest thing Irrational takes away, right at the halfway mark of the
            game, is hope. It’s the reveal of insane AI Shodan that turns your expectations on their head, and it’s one
            of
            our favorite moments in gaming.</p>
        <p>Irrational made games where the environment is the central character, and here, that character is the Von
            Braun.
            It creaks and moans as you pad quietly down its corridors. Every door you open yelps. Its security systems
            attack you as if you hurt their feelings. Staying on the good side of this character is hard, but Shock 2’s
            leveling system of earning experience points through exploration balances the risks and rewards. Some play
            through with all guns blazing, but the psionics skills balance well with combat, and Tech skills open new
            areas
            later in the game. There’s a lot of balance to be found in what on the surface looks like a streamlined
            action
            RPG skill system.</p>

        <h2>7. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The release of Fallout 4 demonstrated that some cracks are starting to appear in Bethesda's usually reliable
            open
            world model, but that model seemed earthshaking back when Morrowind hit literal shelves way back in 2002.
            There
            was a magic in knowing you could tromp all over the island of Vvardenfell without even encountering a
            loading
            screen save upon entering buildings, and in seeing that the NPC population seemed to have lives beyond their
            interactions with you.</p>
        <p>Plenty of other games have achieved similar effects in the years since, but the wonder of Morrowind is that
            it
            still holds up all these years later—even more so than its technically superior successor Oblivion. A lot of
            that appeal springs from the delicious surrealism of Vvardenfell itself, where racist elves hang out in
            twisty
            mushrooms like smurfs in an acid dream, and where the more traditional castles of occupying foreigners clash
            with the landscape like pueblos in Scandinavia. The AI might often seem primitive by today's standards, but
            the
            stories the tell often rival those in prettier contemporary RPGs.</p>
        <p>It thrives still, thanks in part to its own strengths and a dedicated modding community that creates
            countless
            new adventures and keeps it looking more modern than it actually is (even going so far as to port the
            entirety
            of Morrowind into newer game engines).</p>

            align='right'>
        <h2>6. Dragon Age Origins</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Capturing that old Baldur’s Gate feel was goal number one for Dragon Age, and it comes pretty close. Ferelden
            evokes much of the Forgotten Realms without feeling like a rehash, and your relationship with your team has
            that
            old BioWare magic. The darkspawn feel like the kind of world-consuming threat that demands our attention,
            even
            if most of them are faceless hunks of evil for us to cut down. We love how Dragon Age treats magic in its
            world,
            in particular the quests that force us to choose how to best handle abominations, the result of a renegade
            mage
            succombing to demonic possession.</p>
        <p>But it’s the combat that feels most familiar, and most fun: the satisfying tactical depth of pausing your
            combat,
            issuing orders, and reacting to the results works like a modern Infinity Engine game should. It’s sad that
            BioWare will never make an RPG like this again—Dragon Age 2 was too streamlined, and Inquisition’s more open
            world—so in many ways, this is the last hurrah for the old BioWare, and a fitting end for its classic
            design.

            align='right'>
        <h2>5. Neverwinter Nights 2</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>We loved BioWare's original Neverwinter Nights from 2002 (and especially its expansions), but as a
            single-player
            experience, Neverwinter Nights 2 was in a class all of its own. Whereas the original had a fairly weak main
            campaign that mainly seemed aimed at showing what the DM kit was capable of, Obsidian Entertainment managed
            to
            equal and arguably outdo BioWare's storytelling prowess in the sequel when it took over the helm.</p>
        <p>The whole affair brimmed with humor, and companions such as the raucous dwarf Khelgar Ironfist still have few
            rivals in personality nine years later. And the quality just kept coming. Shades of The Legend of Zelda: A
            Link
            to the Past reveal themselves in the masterful Shadow of the Betrayer expansion's focus on two halves of the
            same world, but Obsidian skillfully uses that familiar framework to deliver an unforgettable commentary on
            religion.</p>

        <h2>4. Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The smartest Final Fantasy game finally got a PC port in 2018. The game can't render the sort of streaming
            open
            worlds we're used to these days, but the art still looks great, and the gambit system is still one of the
            most
            fun party development systems in RPG history. Gambits let you program party members with a hierarchy of
            commands
            that they automatically follow in fights. You're free to build any character in any direction you wish. You
            can
            turn the street urchin Vaan into a broadsword-wielding combat specialist or a elemental wizard. The port
            even
            includes a fast-forward mode that make the grinding painless.</p>

            align='right'>
        <h2>3. Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Let’s face it: the real-money auction house was a bad idea, one of a few in the original Diablo 3 release.
            Blizzard nixed the cash auctions right before Reaper of Souls’ release, but it’s the addition of Adventure
            Mode
            that turned the game around from disappointing sequel to crowning achievement for the series. Instead of
            rehashing the game’s acts, Adventure Mode’s task-based milestones and randomized areas make the game feel
            fresh
            for much longer. It’s a standout mode, and it’d be hard to imagine playing Diablo 3 any other way.</p>
        <p>But RoS added another feature that changes the way we love our action RPGs: guild support. Having friends to
            talk
            to as you grind through a dungeon, even if they’re not with you, makes the game far less lonesome, and it’s
            that
            kind of small touch that justifies Blizzard’s always-online philosophy. Adding all this to the
            already-tremendous feeling of wiping out hordes of baddies with a well-timed ability change, RoS is the
            defining
            action RPG for us. It’s a game we’ll be playing for a long, long time.</p>

        <h2>2. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While BioWare’s first KOTOR is a Star Wars classic, KOTOR 2 takes the franchise in a bolder direction.
            Instead of
            focusing on the Light or Dark sides of the Force, the Jedi Exile of Obsidian’s sequel deals in shades of
            gray.
            Alliances are made, then broken, then remade in the aftermath. Choices you think are good just turn out to
            betray other characters. The end result is possibly the most nuanced take on The Force in the entire Star
            Wars
            Expanded Universe, and definitely its most complex villains.</p>
        <p>Like many Obsidian early games, KOTOR 2’s truncated development meant that whole areas had to be cut out. A
            fan-made mod restores much of that content, including a droid planet, and fixes lots of outstanding bugs,
            showing yet again that PC gamers will work hard to maintain their favorite games.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DiExCH3icvs5CapepRwtRK-650-80.png" alt="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"
            align='right'>
        <h2>1. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Pick a direction and run. You’re almost guaranteed to discover some small adventure, some small chunk of
            world
            that will engage you. It’s that content density that makes Skyrim constantly rewarding. A visit to the
            Mage’s
            Guild will turn into an area-spanning search for knowledge. A random chat with an NPC will lead you to a
            far-off
            dungeon, searching for a legendary relic. You could be picking berries on the side of a mountain and
            discover a
            dragon. Oops, accidental dragon fight.</p>
        <p>And if you somehow exhaust all of Bethesda’s content, rest assured that modders have more waiting for you in
            Steam Workshop—that lively community has kept Skyrim in the Steam top 100 since its release, and given us
            endless ways to adventure through a great world. Some on the PC Gamer team keep a modded-up Skyrim install
            handy, just in case they feel like adventure. That’s some high praise.</p>
